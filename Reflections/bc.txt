1.Pascal's Traingle uses binomial coefficiants.
2.There are two ways to get binomial coefficiants
  a) Reursive
  b) Dynamic programing
  
3.The recurance relation to generate binomial coefficiants is
  C(0,n)=C(0,0)=1
  C(n,k)=C(n-1,k-1)+C(n-1,k) where n>k>0.
  
4.In dyanmic programing we can add the two previous terms in array to get the net number.
5.The dynamic table uses n*k bytes of memory.
6.The recursive program takes (2^n - 1)*8 bytes,since for every recursive function call a new memory stack is created.
7.From the above points we can say that dynamic programing takes less memory and is more efficiant.
