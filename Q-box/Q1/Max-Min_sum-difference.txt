Title:Max-min_sum-difference
Level:Easy

Problem Statement:
Given an array ‘a’ of ‘N’ integers find the minimum and maximum array element and print their sum and difference. 
If all the array elements are same (i.e No minimum) then print NULL as the output.

Input Format: 
The first line contains a single integer N denoting the size of the array.
The second line contains n space separated array values.


Constraints:
2<=N<=100
-10000<= a[i] <=10000


Output Format:
Two space separated values denoting the sum and difference of the maximum and minimum array elements.


Sample Test Cases:
Sample input 0:
7
1 5 6 9 8 7 3
Sample output 0:
10 8
Explanation 0:
The minimum element is 1 and maximum element is 9,so sum=10 and difference =8



Sample input 1:
4
3 3 3 3
Sample output 1:
NULL NULL
Explanation 1:
All the array elements are same, therefore no minimum element.
